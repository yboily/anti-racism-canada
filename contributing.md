Contribution Guidelines

The preferred method of contribution is via a pull request, however that may present a technical hurdle.  Feel free to make suggestions via comments, Github issues, or send me an email to yvanboily@gmail.com

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
* Suggest resources or articles by providing a link to the content, and a write-up of why you think it should be included.  It doesn't need to be an essay, just a line or two.  If you can, please provide information about how you came across the resource.
* Read the awesome manifesto and ensure your list complies.
* Make sure your suggestion is on-topic.  The focus is on anti-racist resources, but not exclusively.
* Make an individual pull request or comment for each suggestion.
* Try to ensure that you follow the same format, and alphabetize by attribution and article name if multiple resources from the same source are added.

When considering suggestions, or challenging the validity of the content, please consider Karl Popper's [Paradox of Tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) before posting.  You can find a TL;DR version [here](https://agnostic.com/post/158028/as-paradoxical-as-it-may-seem-defending-intolerance-requires-to-not-tolerate-the-intolerant-htt).  It is one of the lenses I will use to evaluate feedback, but I will also solicit input from other folks that I know and trust on this topic.

If you think that any of the content referenced here is problematic, please open an issue detailing which content you would like me to reconsider, an explanation why, and if possible, a link to a resource I could consider using as a replacement.  The Internet can also be an awful place, so if you would prefer not to have the discussion in public, please feel free to email me.

Cheers,
Yvan Boily
