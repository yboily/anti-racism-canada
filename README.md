# Canadian Anti-Racist Resources

A collection of resources to learn about anti-racism and the modern reality and history of racism and discrimination in Canada.  This list is meant as a complement to other anti-racist resources such as [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BRlF2_zhNe86SGgHa6-VlBO-QgirITwCTugSfKie5Fs/edit), rather than a replacement.

This collection is not a complete reference, and is based on a collection of bookmarks, browser history, and content recommendations from social media, friends, and family.  While I do my best to make sure that the content is on topic and relevant, most of these sources are internet based, and several are references to personal blogs; please see [this page](contributing.md) for information on how to contribute additional resources, or to challenge the quality or validity of resources present.


While the focus is on anti-racism, any resources are welcome that help to shine the light on challenges faced by, or provide resources to help support all marginalized communities, including BIPOC, members of the LGBTQ+ communities, and other marginalized groups.  This collection can be used as a lens to focus on Canadian Indigenous, national, historical, and cultural contexts while navigating the broader international discussion of racism, anti-Black racism, and other issues.
